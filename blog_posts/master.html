          In my master thesis I looked at movement of people and how much time people used in spaces, using GPS data. 
          I wanted to look at this from the perspective of places. So the maps I am showing in this blog are from the perspective 
          of the raster cells of a resolution of 50m, and how much time has been occupied by people in the time frame, 
          and then compared to what could be expected. Throughout the master I have used a kernel density analysis to create the raster data and the cells I am using
           to study as places. A kernel density is creating a form of a heat map.

          This is the overview using a kernel density of the home addresses of the 273 respondents, compared to the address dataset
          on appartement level from Kartverket.
