          <p>
          In my master thesis I looked at movement of people and how much time people used in spaces, using GPS data. 
          I wanted to look at this from the perspective of places. So the maps I am showing in this blog are from the perspective 
          of the raster cells of a resolution of 50m, and how much time has been occupied by people in the time frame, 
          and then compared to what could be expected. Throughout the master I have used a kernel density analysis to create the raster data and the cells I am using
           to study as places. A kernel density is creating a form of a heat map.
          </p> 
          
          <p>
            Before I started my analysis I first wanted to check the spatial distribution compared the general population
            distribution in the Oslo metropolitan area. I did not have data for the population distribution, but I used a address list
            by apartment level from Kartverket (Norwegian Mapping Agency) as a proxy for population distribution. The reason I wanted 
            to do this is because I wanted to see how representative the respondentâ€™s spatial distribution was. As seen in the map below 
            omparing the spatial distribution of the respondents with all address points it showcases that the the spatial distribution
            is given it's small sample size relative representative.

            <h2> Creating the model to simulate the potential for travel</h2>
          <p>
           The next step of the process was to create a model which could simulate the potential activty of the respondents 
            to better compare the use of space in Oslo. Due to security reasons the address points of respondents and
            trip information was separeted. This resulted in me having to use the average trip lenght (3885.9m) as the distance for 
            the service area anaylsis I did for each address.  
          </p>

          <p>
           The model iterates over the point file of the addresses of the 226 respondents. For each address it adds it as a location for
            a Service Area network analysis. It then export the line file from the service area. I wanted to simulate how the GPS
            signal records the users position and is not a contious signal. I found the average distance between each GPS 
            recording from the trips by calculating the average distance between each vertecies of the line polygons (33.9m). I then 
            dissolved the lines from the service area and sampled points from this file every 33.9m using generate point along lines. 
            Then I appended this feature to the output file.

           The result of this model where a file with 4.129 million points. Similar to the GPS recordings from the respondents I
            made a Kernel Density analysis of the travel potential of the respondents to have a better comparison for the use of space
            in Oslo Metropolitian area.

            Comparing the observed with the expected
          </h2>
          
          <p>
           To more easely and accuratly compare the results I created a Normalized Difference Index of the Observed and expected
            raster layers. To do this I simeply used the formula in raster calculator for the Kernal Density results: <br> 
            <b>(Observed - Expected) / (Observed + Expected)</b> <br>
            As I used the average trip distance for the potential for travel, there was a lot of areas which never could be reached by
            the model. To make the map more readable and highlight the high values that actually could be reached, I exlueded the value 
            1 from the map. As -1 (Blue) is a very high value in expected and low in observed, and 1 (Red) is a very high value in observed
            and a low value in expected.

            Not suprisingly there is more activity in around transportation artereis and hubs. However this is the type of map
            I used for futher compare rush hour with none rush hour, and weekend vs none weeked observations.

          <h2>
            Considering the temporal dimension
          </h2>
          
          <p>
            When I compared the NDI's of rush hour vs not rush hour and weekend vs workdays, I inspected the cell statistics of 
            the raster. I knew my sample size was very small for quantitative analysis, even though the spatial distribution had been
            pretty good. My reasoning was that values of either 1 or -1 are cells where there was no overlap of the compared raster data.
            This means that for the rush hour map, a cell with the value 1 or -1 where cells where either only people had been during 
            rush traffic or outside of rush traffic. The overwhelming majority of cells had the value 1 or -1 for both rush hour and for 
            weekend map. This solidified that my master thesis would only be a exploratory in nature and focused on methodology rather than
            findings.
          </p>
          
          <p>
           To compare rush traffic with none rush traffic I used the Norwegian Public Roads Administrations time on rush hour
            tax as the temporal devider. Creating an NDI comparing this selection to each other resulted in this map.
